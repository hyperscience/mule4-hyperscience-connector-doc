|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number a| Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

* Configure a larger buffer size to reduce the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. Doing so increases performance, but it also requires additional memory, which limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process.

* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the size of the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size* value. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | Amount by which the buffer size expands if its initial size is smaller than the size of the data stream. Setting a value of `0` or lower prevents the buffer from expanding. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` indicates that there is no maximum size limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** `BYTE`
** `KB`
** `MB`
** `GB` | Unit for the *Initial Buffer Size*, *Buffer Size Increment*, and *Buffer Unit* fields. |  |
